Experiments with developing a modular game sequel/extension to an old raycasting city engine I did up long ago (a modification to Andre Michelle's raycaster http://lab.andre-michelle.com/raycaster-v3), using the Swft Framework with XML serialization and F*CSS styling support for entities and components.

Currently nothing much yet but bare bones/organisation.
