Dev experiments of developing a modular game sequel/extension to an old raycasting tile-based 3D city engine I did up long ago (a modification to Andre Michelle's casual raycaster at http://lab.andre-michelle.com/raycaster-v3). Currently, I'm running this under the Swft Framework (http://github.com/mikecann/Swft) platform under Flash. However, engine-related code and settings are hard-coded and re-assembled under Haxe, using Alchemy opcodes to run the raycaster engine smoothly at higher resolutions in a non-debug Flash version 10 player. This is still a work in progress under optimisation/testing phase across different org.cityfly.view.raycasting branches  (which is the main package zone containing useful concrete stuff, while the rest is mostly b-s.). You can easily the whole archive and compare the various engine implementations for yourself.
