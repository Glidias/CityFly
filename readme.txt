Experiments with developing a modular game sequel/extension to an old raycasting city engine I did up long ago (a modification to Andre Michelle's raycaster http://lab.andre-michelle.com/raycaster-v3), using the Swft Framework with XML serialization and F*CSS styling support for entities and components.

Currently nothing much yet but just the bare bones/organisation. Looking into hierachical hash grids, among other stuffs.

Old stuff for viewing at: \bin\oldstuff\

Entity xml templates  and stylings at \bin\xml\entities.xml

Main src files at: \org\cityfly\
