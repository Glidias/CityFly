Experiments with developing a modular game sequel/extension to an old raycasting city engine I did up long ago (a modification to Andre Michelle's raycaster http://lab.andre-michelle.com/raycaster-v3), using the Swft Framework (http://github.com/mikecann/Swft)  with XML serialization and F*CSS styling support for entities and components. (http://wiki.github.com/Glidias/CityFly/xml-serialization-and-fcss-specifications)

Currently nothing much yet but just some coding tryouts with swft, bare bones & organisation. This repo is more to looking into hierachical hash grids, among other stuffs.
